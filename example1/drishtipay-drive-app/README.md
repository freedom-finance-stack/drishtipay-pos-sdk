# DrishtiPay POS SDK Integration - Successful Setup

## Overview

This project successfully integrates the **DrishtiPay POS SDK** (v0.0.1) from the private GitHub repository `freedom-finance-stack/drishtipay-pos-sdk`.

## Integration Method Used

Since the library was not published to Maven Central or GitHub Packages, we used the **Local AAR** approach:

1. **Cloned the private repository** using GitHub CLI authentication
2. **Built the SDK locally** to generate the AAR file
3. **Copied the AAR** to `app/libs/drishtipay-pos-sdk-0.0.1.aar`
4. **Added local dependency** in `app/build.gradle`:
   ```gradle
   implementation files('libs/drishtipay-pos-sdk-0.0.1.aar')
   ```

## Current Setup

### Files Modified:
- `app/build.gradle` - Added local AAR dependency
- `MainActivity.kt` - Added basic SDK initialization example
- `gradle.properties` - Added GitHub authentication credentials
- `settings.gradle` - Added repository configurations (backup options)

### Integration Example:

The `MainActivity.kt` now includes a working example of SDK initialization:

```kotlin
private fun initializeDrishtiPaySDK() {
    try {
        // Initialize the POS NFC Device Manager in mock mode
        nfcManager = PosNfcDeviceManager(this)
        Log.d("MainActivity", "DrishtiPay POS SDK initialized successfully!")
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Log.e("MainActivity", "Failed to initialize DrishtiPay SDK", e)
    }
}
```

## Build Status

âœ… **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** - The project compiles and runs successfully with the DrishtiPay SDK integrated.

## Key SDK Classes Available:

- `PosNfcDeviceManager` - Main NFC device manager
- `INfcDeviceManager` - Interface for NFC operations
- `PaymentStatus` - Enum for payment status
- `CardType` - Enum for card types
- `Network` - Enum for card networks
- Various model classes for payment processing

## Next Steps

1. **Development**: Use the SDK classes to implement payment functionality
2. **Testing**: Test NFC payment flows in mock mode
3. **Production**: Replace mock mode with actual POS device plugins
4. **Updates**: When new SDK versions are released, repeat the build process

## File Structure

```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ libs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ drishtipay-pos-sdk-0.0.1.aar    # Local SDK dependency
â”œâ”€â”€ src/main/java/.../MainActivity.kt    # Integration example
â””â”€â”€ build.gradle                        # Dependency configuration
```

## Authentication Setup

The project is configured with GitHub CLI authentication and includes backup repository configurations for future use with JitPack or GitHub Packages if the SDK is published there.
